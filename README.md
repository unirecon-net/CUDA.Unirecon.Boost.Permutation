# CUDA.Unirecon.Boost.Permutation

Research version of the algorithm accelerating pattern finding in problems with complexity equal to the permutation of elements (Boost.Permutation). Like finding the shortest path between points by brute-force with optimization. It addresses the problem of graphs and the traveling salesman.
